            <h2>Enterprise Application Integration</h2>
            <p>
                Enterprise Application Integration provides a systems integration technology enabling different applications to interact in a standard, well-defined and controlled manner. In a way, it is an implementation methodology to drive an integration project. EAI aims to transform current IT environments so that it supports business objectives better and produces high return on IT investments.
                <br><br>
                EAI provides an infrastructure where application domain can achieve to plug-and-play. Even though most of the large organization have been investing in this technology for many years, there are so many more in the planning or implementation phases. Organizations moving towards EAI needs to understand that the overall integration through EAI cannot be achieved in on giant step. Instead, EAI philosophy is based on progressive migration approach.

            <p>
                Today's competitive business environment is forcing the control of information technology project investments into becoming a necessary and vital part of business behavior. IT managers are no longer able to approve large expenditure without a strong commercial business case showing a high return on investment (ROI).
                <br><br>
                Another factor driving a commercial focus amongst IT managers are statistics that show that a very high percentage of IT projects fail to deliver a ROI over an acceptable time frame.
                <br><br>

            <p>
                Doriath Technology engineers have been providing project implementation and SI projects to one of the biggest Network Operators in Europe in the last ten years. In today's fast growing Telecommunication market, performance is everything. You usually need big machines to crunch complex tariff models, promotions and invoices in a timely manner.
                <br><br>
                However, as the systems (HW,SW) are becoming more complex, it is sometimes very difficult to determine where performance bottlenecks are. Sometimes, the problems can be due to IT network connections, hardware, storage, database or application.
                <br><br>
                Doriath Technology has a Performance Check List types questionnaire to determine what type of Performance Analysis services to offer. A full offer might include domain experts from all HW and SW elements. However, if the organizations have a good idea about performance bottlenecks then more focused experts will be deployed.
                <br><br>
                After Doriath Technology's analysis, corrective tuning actions will be specified and if agreed, will be taken by Doriath Technology in the productive systems.
